Instruction how to run the application.

We know that Ajarn uses Eclips and we tried to export it to this IDE but there were some problems
 with our external library (DBUtils) and we did not know how to fix it.
We used Intellij IDE and everything will work if followed

1. Setup database in MySQL with DBscript.sql and insertScrpit.sql from DATABASE folder.
2. Open project with Intellij
3. Got to pom.xml and download Maven dependencies
4. Install manually rs2xml.jar by inputing this in console.
	Please make sure you have Maven in environment variable in Windows

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=C:\rs2xml.jar -DgroupId=net.proteanit.sql
    -DartifactId=rs2xml -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar
	
	!!!Replace the path C:\rs2xml.jar with the actual location on your computer which is in thaibooking\JARs\rs2xml.jar!!!
	
5. Change MySQL database parameters in thaibooking\src\main\java\utils\dbproperties file for the one of own MySQL server
6. Run the application :)
